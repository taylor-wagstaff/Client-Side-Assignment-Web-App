          The idea for Time Mates was born out of a simple yet recurrent
          problem: keeping track of what time it is where our friends and family
          live. In a world that is more connected than ever, with friends,
          colleagues, and loved ones spread across different cities, countries,
          and time zones, coordinating a simple phone call or virtual
          get-together became a challenge.
        </p>

        <p>
          We realized that there was a need for a straightforward solution to
          this problem. And so, Time Mates was born.

          Simply add your friends name to places then easily see the time of their
          respective locations.
